This project is a variation of the qTagGer tool originally developed by RGSchindler.
It enables the automatic design of primers for overlapping regions, making it easy to integrate into cloning or primer design pipelines. 
The tool simplifies the process of verifying successful recombination of different DNA fragments through PCR 
by allowing users to quickly generate the necessary primers.
